To set up Terraform on a minimal installation of Oracle Linux 9, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Prepare Oracle Linux 9
1. **Update your system** to ensure it has the latest patches:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf update -y
   ```

2. **Install basic tools** like `dnf-plugins-core` if not already available:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install -y dnf-plugins-core
   ```

### Step 2: Install HashiCorp's Repository
HashiCorp provides a YUM repository for easy installation of their tools, including Terraform.

1. **Add the HashiCorp repository** to your system:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://rpm.releases.hashicorp.com/RHEL/hashicorp.repo
   ```

2. **Enable the HashiCorp repository** in case it’s disabled by default:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf config-manager --set-enabled hashicorp
   ```

### Step 3: Install Terraform
With the repository added, installing Terraform is straightforward:

```bash
sudo dnf install -y terraform
```

This command installs the latest stable version of Terraform and its dependencies.

### Step 4: Verify the Installation
Check that Terraform is installed and accessible:

```bash
terraform -v
```

If installed correctly, this command will display the version of Terraform.

### Step 5: (Optional) Set Up Bash Completion for Terraform
If you frequently use the CLI, enabling bash completion can be helpful.

1. **Install bash-completion** if not already installed:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install -y bash-completion
   ```

2. **Enable Terraform CLI autocompletion**:
   ```bash
   terraform -install-autocomplete
   ```

### Step 6: Run a Test to Ensure Functionality
1. Create a directory for your Terraform files:
   ```bash
   mkdir ~/terraform-test && cd ~/terraform-test
   ```

2. Initialize a test configuration with the following minimal configuration:

   ```bash
   echo 'terraform {
       required_providers {
           null = {
               source  = "hashicorp/null"
               version = "~> 3.0"
           }
       }
   }
   
   provider "null" {}
   
   resource "null_resource" "test" {
       provisioner "local-exec" {
           command = "echo Hello, Terraform!"
       }
   }' > main.tf
   ```

3. **Run Terraform commands** to initialize, plan, and apply:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform apply -auto-approve
   ```

### Summary
- You’ve installed Terraform on Oracle Linux 9 from HashiCorp’s YUM repository.
- You’ve run a basic configuration to confirm that it works.

With Terraform set up, you’re ready to start creating and managing infrastructure resources! Let me know if you need further guidance on specific Terraform configurations.
