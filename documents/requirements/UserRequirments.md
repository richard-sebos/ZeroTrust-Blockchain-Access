# **End-User Guide for Blockchain-Enabled Zero Trust Access to NAS Files**

## **Project Overview**

Welcome to the Blockchain-Enabled Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) File Access System! This system is designed to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive files on a network-attached storage (NAS) system. Using blockchain technology, it validates user identity and permissions before granting access, ensuring a secure environment based on the principles of Zero Trust.

## **What Is Zero Trust Architecture?**

Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) is a security framework where access to resources is only granted after strict verification, regardless of the user's location within the network. Unlike traditional security models that assume users inside a network are trustworthy, ZTA requires that all users be continuously validated.

In this project, we're leveraging blockchain technology to handle access verification. This means that each access request is validated against a secure, tamper-resistant ledger to confirm that the user has the appropriate permissions.

## **How the System Works**

1. **User Access Request**:
   - When you try to access a file on the NAS, the system sends a request to verify your identity and permissions.

2. **Blockchain Verification**:
   - This access request is processed through a blockchain network where smart contracts check whether you have the right permissions.
   - Only if the permissions match, the blockchain approves access.

3. **Access Granted or Denied**:
   - If verified, the system grants you access to the file on the NAS.
   - If your identity or permissions do not match, access is denied, and the event is logged.

## **Getting Started**

### Step 1: **Setting Up Your Access**

To gain access to the system, you must have the following:
   - **User ID**: Assigned by the system administrator.
   - **Blockchain Key**: A unique identifier stored on the blockchain that verifies your identity.

### Step 2: **Requesting Access**

Once you have your user ID and blockchain key, follow these steps to request access:

1. **Log in to the System**: Using a secure connection, log into the user portal where you can request access to the NAS.
2. **Access Verification**:
   - Enter your user ID and access request information. This information is sent to the blockchain for validation.
3. **Wait for Blockchain Approval**:
   - The blockchain smart contract checks your identity and permissions.
   - If approved, you'll receive a notification that access is granted. You may then proceed to the NAS.

### Step 3: **Accessing Files on the NAS**

Once verified:
   - **Access the NAS**: Connect to the NAS using a secure protocol (e.g., SSH or SFTP) to view or download files.
   - **Session Monitoring**: The system monitors each session for security. If you're inactive for a certain period, the session will automatically log out.

## **User Responsibilities**

To keep the system secure, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- **Maintain Your Credentials**: Never share your user ID or blockchain key with anyone.
- **Report Issues Immediately**: If you encounter any errors or believe your credentials may have been compromised, report this to the system administrator.
- **Follow Access Protocols**: Use only approved methods (SSH or SFTP) to access files and avoid circumventing security procedures.
- **Log Out When Finished**: Always end your session properly by logging out to avoid unauthorized access if you're away from your workstation.

## **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

1. **Access Denied Notification**:
   - Check that you have entered your user ID and blockchain key correctly.
   - If the problem persists, contact the administrator to ensure your permissions are up-to-date.

2. **Inactive Session Logouts**:
   - If your session logs out frequently, it could be due to inactivity settings. Log in again, or ask an administrator if the timeout settings need adjustment.

3. **File Access Issues**:
   - If you're unable to view or download a file, confirm that your access permissions include that specific file or directory.
   - You may need additional permissions for certain directories; if so, contact the administrator.

4. **Lost or Compromised Blockchain Key**:
   - If you believe your blockchain key has been lost or compromised, contact the administrator immediately to reset your credentials.

## **Security & Privacy Considerations**

- **Data Encryption**: All files transferred between your device and the NAS are encrypted.
- **Audit Logs**: Every access request is logged in the blockchain and monitored by the system for security and auditing purposes.
- **Privacy Protection**: Your identity is verified without storing sensitive information directly on the blockchain; only encrypted identifiers are stored.
