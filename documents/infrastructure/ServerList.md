   - **Suggested DNS Name**: `proxmox-mgmt.local`

---

## **2. Terraform and Ansible Orchestration Server**

   - **Server Name**: `automation-server`
   - **Role**: Runs Terraform for infrastructure provisioning and Ansible for configuration management, handling deployment and updates across all project servers.
   - **Suggested DNS Name**: `automation.local`

---

## **3. Zero Trust Authentication Server**

   - **Server Name**: `ztrust-auth`
   - **Role**: Hosts the Zero Trust microservices/API that handles identity verification through blockchain, ensuring users have permission to access the NAS.
   - **Suggested DNS Name**: `ztrust-auth.local`

---

## **4. Blockchain Network Nodes**

   - **Server Names**: `blockchain-node1`, `blockchain-node2`, `blockchain-node3`
   - **Role**: Nodes within the blockchain network that store access records, validate permissions, and execute smart contracts. A minimum of three nodes supports redundancy and reliability.
   - **Suggested DNS Names**:
     - Primary Node: `bc-node1.local`
     - Secondary Node: `bc-node2.local`
     - Tertiary Node: `bc-node3.local`

---

## **5. NAS Authentication and Access Proxy Server**

   - **Server Name**: `nas-proxy`
   - **Role**: Acts as a proxy between users and the NAS, checking permissions with the Zero Trust Authentication Server before allowing access to NAS files.
   - **Suggested DNS Name**: `nas-proxy.local`

---

## **6. Network Firewall Server (OPNSense)**

   - **Server Name**: `opnsense-fw`
   - **Role**: Provides network security and segmentation, enforcing Zero Trust policies by controlling access between the internal network and ZTA services.
   - **Suggested DNS Name**: `opnsense.local`

---

## **7. Debian NAS Server**

   - **Server Name**: `nas-server`
   - **Role**: Stores project files and provides access through the NAS Proxy, using strict access controls.
   - **Suggested DNS Name**: `nas.local`

---

## **8. Monitoring and Logging Server**

   - **Server Name**: `monitoring-server`
   - **Role**: Hosts monitoring tools (e.g., Grafana, Prometheus) and aggregates logs from all servers, providing health and security insights.
   - **Suggested DNS Name**: `monitor.local`

---

## **9. DNS Server**

   - **Server Name**: `dns-server`
   - **Role**: Provides centralized DNS resolution within the network. All project servers will query this DNS server to resolve internal DNS names, ensuring network stability and simplifying hostname management.
   - **Suggested DNS Name**: `dns.local`

---

## **10. NTP Server**

   - **Server Name**: `ntp-server`
   - **Role**: Synchronizes time across all project servers. Accurate time is essential for logging, blockchain synchronization, and security protocols. The NTP server will connect to public NTP servers (such as `pool.ntp.org`) and provide local time synchronization to all servers.
   - **Suggested DNS Name**: `ntp.local`
