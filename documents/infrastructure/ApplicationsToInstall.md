- **SSL/TLS Certificates**: For securing API communications.
- **Logging Agent**: For forwarding logs to the Monitoring Server (e.g., `rsyslog` or `Filebeat`).
- **Basic Utilities**: `htop`, `vim`, `curl`, `wget`, `net-tools`.

---

### **4. NAS Proxy Server (`nas-proxy.local`)**

- **Proxy Server Software**: Such as `NGINX` or `HAProxy` to route requests securely between users and the NAS.
- **SSL/TLS Certificates**: To secure connections.
- **Firewall**: Configured to restrict direct access to NAS, allowing only requests that pass through the Zero Trust verification.
- **Logging Agent**: For forwarding access logs to the Monitoring Server.
- **SSH**: For management access.
- **Basic Utilities**: `htop`, `vim`, `curl`, `wget`, `net-tools`.

---

### **5. OPNSense Firewall (`opnsense.local`)**

- **OPNSense**: Open-source firewall software with ZTA security configurations.
- **Intrusion Detection/Prevention**: OPNSense plugins, such as Suricata, for monitoring and alerting.
- **Logging and Reporting**: OPNSense native logging for security events.
- **Backup and Configuration Plugins**: To manage snapshots and configuration backups (e.g., integration with Proxmox Backup Server).

---

### **6. Blockchain Nodes (`bc-node1.local`, `bc-node2.local`, `bc-node3.local`)**

- **Blockchain Software**: (e.g., `Hyperledger Fabric` or `Geth` for Ethereum).
- **Smart Contract Runtime**: Install support for smart contracts (e.g., `Solidity` compiler for Ethereum).
- **Firewall**: To allow blockchain traffic only between the nodes and the Zero Trust Authentication Server.
- **Logging Agent**: To forward blockchain transaction logs to the Monitoring Server.
- **SSH**: For management access.
- **Basic Utilities**: `htop`, `vim`, `curl`, `wget`, `net-tools`.

---

### **7. NAS Server (`nas.local`)**

- **NAS Software**: (if needed) such as `Samba` for file sharing or `NFS` for network file systems.
- **SSH**: To secure access for maintenance.
- **Authentication Module**: Plugin or script to validate access via Zero Trust Authentication Server.
- **Backup Client**: For integration with the Proxmox Backup Server if file backups are required.
- **Firewall**: To restrict access, allowing only authenticated requests from the NAS Proxy.
- **Logging Agent**: To forward access logs to the Monitoring Server.
- **Basic Utilities**: `htop`, `vim`, `curl`, `wget`, `net-tools`.

---

### **8. Monitoring Server (`monitor.local`)**

- **Prometheus**: For collecting and querying metrics.
- **Grafana**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Logging Aggregator**: (e.g., `ElasticSearch`, `Graylog`, or `Logstash`) to collect and analyze logs from other servers.
- **Alerting System**: Integration with Grafana or other alerting tools for notifications.
- **SSH**: For management access.
- **Basic Utilities**: `htop`, `vim`, `curl`, `wget`, `net-tools`.

---

### **9. DNS Server (`dns.local`)**

- **DNS Software**: (e.g., `BIND9` or `dnsmasq`) to provide internal DNS resolution.
- **Firewall**: Restrict DNS queries to internal network traffic only.
- **Logging Agent**: For DNS query logs forwarded to the Monitoring Server.
- **SSH**: For management access.
- **Basic Utilities**: `htop`, `vim`, `curl`, `wget`, `net-tools`.

---

### **10. NTP Server (`ntp.local`)**

- **NTP Software**: (e.g., `ntpd` or `chrony`) for time synchronization.
- **Firewall**: Restrict NTP requests to internal network traffic only.
- **Logging Agent**: To forward NTP synchronization logs to the Monitoring Server.
- **SSH**: For management access.
- **Basic Utilities**: `htop`, `vim`, `curl`, `wget`, `net-tools`.

---

### **Common Software on All Servers**

- **Operating System**: Debian or Ubuntu LTS for consistent management (or a chosen Linux distro across all servers).
- **SSH**: To secure remote access.
- **Firewall**: To control and limit access based on each server's role (e.g., `ufw` or `firewalld`).
- **Security Tools**: Basic hardening tools like `fail2ban`, `unattended-upgrades` (if applicable), and regular system updates.
- **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - **Logging Agent**: `Filebeat`, `rsyslog`, or `Syslog-ng` to centralize logs on the Monitoring Server.
   - **Metrics Collection**: `node_exporter` for Prometheus to gather basic system metrics.
